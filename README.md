# DisperseAiGUI

## Summary

This project will help detect the presence and movement of big crowds. The advent of crowd detecting AI and early detection could help avoid serious injuries and other health concerns by warning people of crowding. The information could be relayed to an official who could help disperse a crowd. Another problem with crowding is loss of information. Showing the crowd on screen will give people the vital information needed to make the conscious decision to stop pushing because there is nowhere else to go.
